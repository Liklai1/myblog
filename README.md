        <p id="about"> Art is always a thing i do in my free time. Whether digital or traditional. I lean more into the digital side. I started drawing on my phone quite a long time ago. With just tip of the my fingertips, I could make a piece that could speak for me. Since I have a hard time expressing myself to most people, My art speaks for me. Now, I am starting a next phase which is animating. I had been praticing for some months but i soon gave up. Now i got a new inspiration. </p>

    <p id="about2">  Through art, I learned that art itself is not just painting or drawing. Art to me, is a wordless speech. Art for me is something beautiful. Every one of my pieces always carry a meaning. I have been writing for quite long. Every word i write in my journal is something that is out of the world. I created my own small but vast world with drawings and words. I do not like noise at all. So when i first made my world consisting of words that have a lot of meaning to me and drawings that i freely move with my hands, I did not imagine any noise. Nope, it wasn't like the soft flowing water that comes out of fountains or the birds chirping (which i wouldn't even put it in the first place). It was eerily quiet. There wasn't anyone with me. Only me and the water. The soft warm carpets of grass on my barefoot. I love it there. I admit, art can be hard if you don't have imagination. But the more practice, the better. </p>
